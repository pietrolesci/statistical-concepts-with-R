# Statistical Concepts with R
This repository includes the file necessary to create the book "Statistical Concept with R". It is the result of an in-depth curricular course done during my MSc at Bocconi University. The book has been written in [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/) using the [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/) package. 

Each chapter includes code and text. The root file is [index.Rmd](https://github.com/pietrolesci/statistical_concepts_with_R/blob/master/index.Rmd).
